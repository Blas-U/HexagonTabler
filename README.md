# HexagonTabler

Objective: Create a table that detects when you touch it and lights up LEDs on a hexagonal tile.

# Materials
* The laser
* Epoxy
* Wires
* Capacitive touch sensors
* LED strips

# Procedure
* Solder a raspberry pi
* Solder the corresponding wires to the right spots on the sensor and LEDs
* Test what sets off the sensor
* Print the mold using the laser 
* Add the LEDs 
* Hot glue the sensor and test that it works through the wood.


# Discussion 
* We went through multiple prototypes testing what would and wouldn't work
** Many of the learning experiences we went through was by learning the hard way.
* Our inspiration for this table was a video that made the table using a CNC machine. Because we were short of time, we were unable to use our CNC machine, and as a result we needed to come up with a different idea. This is what led to our multiple prototypes and failures. 
* Over all the project went well and we succeded in making a product similar to what our original idea was. In the future we want to make the actual table using the CNC machine and we will learn from our struggles in this project.
