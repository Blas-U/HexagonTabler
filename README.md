# Procedure
salder a raspberry pi
salder the corresponding wires to the right spots of the sensor and the LEDs
test what sets off the sensor

# Discussion
Blas fails a lot 
Lots of prototypes 
We figured a lot of the project out the hard way while attemting to create this. Mostly because there wasn't a solid guide on how things should be arranged and there where some more detailed things that we needed to do. We also changed a lot from the video. Over all the project went great and we succeded in finishing close to what we actually wanted. We can see in the future what needs to be imporoved on and what we are going to work on with this project because we want to make an atual table.
